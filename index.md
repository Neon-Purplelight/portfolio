### Deep NLP for hate speech detection

Hate speech detection is the automated task of determining whether a piece of text contains hateful content. In this project, I built a classifier using PyTorch to fine-tune a BERT model.

### Examining panic-buying during the first wave of Covid-19, using mobility data
The first wave of COVID-19 infections led to widespread stories of shortages in grocery stores as consumers stocked up in anticipation of lockdowns, a behaviour colloquially known as ‘panic buying’. In this project, I used mobility data from Google and Apple to empirically investigate the extent of panic buying in different countries.

### A free and open sample dashboard that focuses on the impacts of climate change on our environment

The project explores the potential of interactive dashboards to convey the complexity of climate change impacts on hydrology, soil, and vegetation. It highlights the challenges of science communication in the digital age, with a particular focus on the critical evaluation of sources and the presentation of scientific data. Through the development and comparative analysis of dashboard solutions, the project aims to make scientific data accessible and understandable to the public. The importance of contextualization and user-centered design is emphasized to create dashboards that educate and engage the audience, fostering a deeper understanding of environmental issues.
