### A free and open sample dashboard that focuses on the impacts of climate change on our environment

<img src="images/kkn_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>

The project explores the potential of interactive dashboards to convey the complexity of climate change impacts on hydrology, soil, and vegetation. It highlights the challenges of science communication in the digital age, with a particular focus on the critical evaluation of sources and the presentation of scientific data. Through the development and comparative analysis of dashboard solutions, the project aims to make scientific data accessible and understandable to the public. The importance of contextualization and user-centered design is emphasized to create dashboards that educate and engage the audience, fostering a deeper understanding of environmental issues.

### Development of measurement technology for determining concrete cover, electrolytic concrete resistance, and potential field using an autonomous measurement platform.

<img src="images/betoscan_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>

The aim of the project was the development of an automated, non-destructive measurement system for detecting reinforcement steel corrosion. An established method for detecting corrosion probabilities is the quasi-non-destructive method of potential field measurement. As a previously little-researched, completely non-destructive variant of potential field measurement, this work focuses on differential potential field measurement. The differential potential field measurement is a probabilistic approach, whose significance can be increased by combining various measurement systems. Therefore, systems for recording the electrolytic concrete resistance and the concrete cover were also included in the work as important parameters regarding the interpretation of differential potential field measurements.

### Examining panic-buying during the first wave of Covid-19, using mobility data
The first wave of COVID-19 infections led to widespread stories of shortages in grocery stores as consumers stocked up in anticipation of lockdowns, a behaviour colloquially known as ‘panic buying’. In this project, I used mobility data from Google and Apple to empirically investigate the extent of panic buying in different countries.
